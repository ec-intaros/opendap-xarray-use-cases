# Subset 2003 Analysis with Xarray

This Notebook provides an overview, as well as practical examples, to access and analyse a subset of NetCDF data from available campaigns collected in the year 2003. This subset of data has been prepared and uploaded on the Hyrax server (https://opendap.terradue.com/hyrax/data/subset_2003/), where it can be accessed directly.

The main steps for executing the Notebook are described below. 

## Set-up

## Retrieval of DDS information

## Visual Analysis: Load and Plot Positions only

### Create Position Dataframe 

### Plot Positions 

### Filter Positions
* By bounding box (BBOX)
* By BBOX and Month of collection
* By BBOX and Time (eg hour) of collection

## Processing: Load and Plot all needed Data (Variables and their Attributes)

### Create Data Dictionary (*data_dict*) 

### Filter Data
* Filtered data by BBOX and One Variable
* Filtered data by BBOX (All Variables)
* Filtered data by BBOX and One Variable, within a DEPTH range
* Filtered data by BBOX (All Variables), within a DEPTH range

### Reference Plots
* Plotting individual Variables per individual Platform
* Plotting individual Variables across aggregated Platforms
